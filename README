This repo shows the implementation of more realistic steering for top-down cars, through the implementation of Ackermann steering geometry.
In the demo, there will be two cars, the one with Ackermann turns better than the one without.
These changes, implemented by me, derive from simple trigonometry.

> The basic idea is to rotate front wheels when user steers and apply engine force on them. Wheels are connected to the car and drag it along.
> Remove sideways velocity from all wheels every frame to simulate tire friction.
> This model does not allow for drifting, but is very servicable for arcade top down car games.
